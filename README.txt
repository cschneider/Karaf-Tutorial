Tutorial Series about writing OSGi applications using the Apache Karaf server.

The tutorials show OSGi standards like ConfigAdmin Service or Blueprint as well Karaf specific implementations like features. The main idea is that
each tutorial shows one specific concept and can be easily tested and extended. Each tutorial should not take more than 30 minutes to read and test.
